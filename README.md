# Quantum Control in the Eyes of Neural Network

 
The folder contains original code in matlab for training deep neural network for proving Bloch theorem and recurrent neural network for learning non-Markovian quantum noise. 


# reference:

1.QIP 2019 submission: quantum control in the eyes of neural networks.


# To Run

0. Generate input output pairs.
1. Put the data and the codes in the same folder.
2. Run policyLearnDriver.m for training DNN, and run learnEnvDriver.m for learning RNN.
